# Building a Mixture of Experts Neural Network from Scratch

## Introduction

The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture represents a powerful approach to machine learning where multiple specialized neural networks (experts) work together to solve complex problems. Each expert learns to handle specific aspects of the input space, while a gating network learns to route inputs to the most appropriate experts.

## Core Components

### 1. Expert Networks

Each expert is a neural network designed to specialize in a particular transformation. A typical expert architecture includes:

- Input layer matching the feature dimensionality
- Multiple hidden layers with ReLU activation
- Output layer matching the target dimensionality
- Skip connections to improve gradient flow
- Layer normalization for stable training

Key design considerations:
- Keep expert architectures identical to ensure fair competition
- Size experts based on sub-task complexity
- Include regularization to prevent overfitting

### 2. Gating Network

The gating network determines how to combine expert outputs. Important aspects include:

- Soft vs hard attention mechanisms
- Temperature scaling for controlling expert specialization
- Load balancing to prevent expert collapse
- Capacity factors to control routing distribution

Implementation considerations:
- Use a smaller network than experts to reduce overhead
- Apply softmax activation for probabilistic routing
- Include auxiliary losses to encourage expert diversity
- Consider sparse gating for efficiency

### 3. Integration Layer

The integration layer combines expert outputs according to gating weights:

- Weighted sum of expert outputs
- Optional mixture density outputs
- Handling of expert failures
- Gradient scaling mechanisms
